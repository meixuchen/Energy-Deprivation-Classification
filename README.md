# Energy-Deprivation-Classification

This repository provides all data and code used in the work on **Exploring Socio-Spatial Inequalities: Energy Deprivation in Small Areas of Great Britain**.

This study delves into the complex dimensions of energy deprivation, extending beyond mere affordability to encompass accessibility and security of essential energy services. Despite governmental efforts to mitigate the crisis, a comprehensive understanding of the spatially concentrated nature of energy deprivation remains elusive, hampering effective policy interventions. Drawing upon diverse datasets, a multidimensional classification is developed to delineate energy deprivation in small areas across Great Britain, incorporating varying domains including energy efficiency, energy access, energy supply and demand, housing conditions, and financial vulnerability. This classification identifies distinct clusters of vulnerability while providing granular insights into the diverse challenges faced by different neighbourhoods. Our findings offer strategic guidance for crafting more effective and equitable policy interventions, supporting European and UK government aims for inclusive energy transitions and aligning with Sustainability Development Goals 1, 7, 10, and 11. The new dataset created through this research serves as a critical resource for policymakers and researchers, facilitating informed decision-making and promoting further analysis of energy poverty in Great Britain and potentially other regions facing similar challenges.
